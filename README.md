# Data-Visualization-Of-Most-Subscribed-YT-Channel

It is a data analysis project involving YouTube channel data.

Aim and Overview of the Project:

The aim of the project is to analyzing and visualizing data related to YouTube channels.
I'm  trying to gain insights into various aspects of YouTube channels, such as subscribers, categories, countries, languages, etc.
By analyzing this data, I am aiming to understand trends, distributions, and relationships within the YouTube channel ecosystem.

Processes Involved in the Project:

Data Loading: I started by loading the dataset using Pandas read_csv() function.
Data Exploration: I explored the dataset by examining the first few rows (data.head()), last few rows (data.tail()), summary statistics (data.describe()), and information about the dataset (data.info()).
Data Visualization: #Important part of the project.
Histograms: Visualizing the distribution of numerical variables using histograms (data.hist()).
Pairplot: Exploring pairwise relationships in the dataset using a pairplot (sns.pairplot()).
Boxplot: Visualizing the distribution of numerical variables using a boxplot (sns.boxplot()).
Pie Charts: Displaying the distribution of categorical variables such as country, brand channel, primary language, and category using pie charts.
Barplot: Showing the total number of subscribers per country using a barplot (sns.barplot()).
Data Aggregation and Grouping:
Grouping data by various columns such as category, brand channel, and country to aggregate statistics.
Summing up the subscribers' count for each group to understand the total subscriber count per category, brand channel, and country.

Overall, the project involves loading, exploring, visualizing, and analyzing the YouTube channel dataset to gain insights into various aspects of YouTube channels such as subscribers, categories, countries, and languages.
